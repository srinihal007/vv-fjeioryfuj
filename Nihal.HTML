            A quick Introduction about Me!
        </h1>
        <p>
            I am Nihal Tammana. I go to Woodrow Wilson Middle School in edison nj.
            I am in 7th grade and I recently started coding in Javascript, HTML and 
            am experimenting with Lua. I am very conscious about our enviornment and 
            the effects new technology can have on it.I want to use my newly developed 
            coding skills to try to make a website and some intersesting apps and 
            projects. I also want to use these projects to highlight the enviornmental
            issues among the young people of my generation. Being a kid myself, I feel that 
            fun interactive games could be the best way of creating awareness among kids as
            it engages their interest level in a much better way compared to boring lectures.
            This project is my first attempt at taking a step towards using my coding
            knowledge for one such goal of saving the enviornment from batteries.
