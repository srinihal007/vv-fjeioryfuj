            Importance of Batteries
        </h2>
        <p>
            Let us think about some of the most commonly used technologies in everyday life.
            Via mobile phones, remote controls for TV's or LED Lights or AC's, etc, or Battery Operated toys like cars or drones etc.
            mobile phones, laptops, even your car or it's keys use batteries.

            If there are NO Batteries, we would have no portable electronic devices at all!
            we would not have mangaed to put spacecrafts in orbit. our medical science would still be mechanical
            our lifetimes would also be shorter. in short, we can say that batteries are pretty much indispensable in today's world.

            But, how safe are these batteries for the enviornment?

        </h2>
        <p>
I believe that the most common hazards of batteries that the general public is aware of are the accidental fires caused by them.
Even I got introduced to this whole topic because of one such fire incident.
Let me tell you a little bit about it through this story!!
